# Conversational AI with GPT-4 Vision, OpenAI Whisper, and TTS
## Overview
This project integrates GPT-4 Vision, OpenAI Whisper, and OpenAI Text-to-Speech (TTS) to create an interactive AI system for conversations. It combines visual and audio inputs for a seamless user experience.

## Components
- **GPT-4 Vision**: Analyzes visual input and generates contextual responses.
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Converts spoken language into text.
- **OpenAI TTS**: Transforms text responses into spoken language.

## Main Files
- `main.py`: Manages audio processing, image encoding, AI interactions, and text-to-speech output.
- `capture.py`: Captures and processes video frames for visual analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- An OpenAI API key (set as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

### Libraries
Install the necessary libraries with the requirements.txt file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Scripts
- **Start `capture.py`**: Captures video frames and saves them for AI analysis.
  - Reads a video file, displays the video, and saves the current frame as `frame.jpg`.
  - Execute with `python capture.py`.

- **Run `main.py` concurrently**: Orchestrates the conversational AI.
  - Continuously listens for user audio input.
  - Transcribes speech to text, captures the current video frame, and sends both to GPT-4 for analysis.
  - Converts the AI's response to speech and plays it back.
  - Execute with `python main.py`.

### Workflow
1. `main.py` listens for audio input and transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper.
2. Meanwhile, `capture.py` captures a video frame.
3. Both the audio transcription and the encoded image are sent to GPT-4 Vision.
4. GPT-4 Vision responds, considering the visual and textual context.
5. The response is vocalized using OpenAI TTS and played to the user.

### Notes
- Ensure both `main.py` and `capture.py` are active for the system to function.
- The video file in `capture.py` can be customized.
- Adequate hardware is recommended for smooth audio and video processing.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a novel approach to combining various AI technologies, creating a dynamic and interactive conversational AI experience. It harnesses the capabilities of GPT-4 Vision, Whisper, and TTS for a comprehensive audio-visual interaction.
